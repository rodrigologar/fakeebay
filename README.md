## Technologies used:
- Python (Django)
- SQLite
- CSS
- HTML
## Implementation:
### User authentication
The app uses the User abstract Django model to handle the creation, deletion, and validation of users.
### Database
The app uses Django Models and Migrations to create the Listing, Bid, Comment, and Watchlist tables of the database.
### Models
The Django models are actually classes, and so I worked with the Object Oriented Programming Paradigm.
